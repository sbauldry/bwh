# bwh
This repository contains replication code for analyses concerning black and white homicide rates across metropolitan areas. The analysis draws on a combination of data sources: (1) CDC Underlying Cause of Death files for 2008 through 2010 and (2) American Community Survey three-year estimates for 2010. Information about obtaining the CDC data can be found at https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html. Information about obtaining the ACS data can be found at factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml#none. The results of this analysis are reported in Feld and Bauldry (2018).
